# Neighbor-Communication

- Implementing neighbor communications 
Write a program of p processes (rank 0, rank 1, â€¦., rank p-1). Allow rank i exchange a message of 
size m with rank i+1. Rank p-1 needs to exchange a message with rank 0. Please first implement 
using MPI_Send() and MPI_Recv(), then implement using MPI_Isend() and MPI_Irecv() to overlap 
sending and receiving messages. Report the performance of your programs with different values 
of p and m. Analyze the scalability in large distributed environments.
